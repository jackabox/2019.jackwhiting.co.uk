    <h1>Moving to Figma</h1>

        <p>In the last 6 months, I&rsquo;ve moved to using <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a> on a permanent basis. I&rsquo;d spent a fair bit of time in and out of the beta, and now with the official launch, it feels more stable and ready for full time use than ever.</p>

<p>With I first tried Figma up it was a bit rough around the edges, it needed refinement and missed some of the fundamentals I was used to, such as Symbols (Sketch had tainted me). This is no longer the case, Figma is packed with handy tools for a solo designer or a team of designers.</p>

<p>The development from the Figma team has been outstanding, they keep iterating, improving and releasing new features. One of my favourite features has been the release of <a href="https://blog.figma.com/team-libraries-in-figma-409fa5e20f7">Team Libraries</a>. When working on several different projects, within a team, I can have access to all the components my team or myself have created. This is super handy when using a consistent design style across multiple projects. Honestly, it&rsquo;s wicked!</p>

<p>Speaking of collaboration, Figma provides a solid collaboration work flow. I can send a link to anyone of my fellow designers, they can sign in and start editing, chopping and sometimes breaking my designs. It&rsquo;s as simple as sharing a link, no large files and no version fragmentation, all the changes are in one place (with version history ðŸ˜±).</p>

<p>Did I mention version control? Being a developer at heart, this is so crucial to my workflow. I like to know that if myself or someone else makes something ugly, I can go ahead and find out why, undo it and go from there or just point fingers at who did and shame them.</p>

<p>Pricing wise, if you&rsquo;re just wanting to have a go at Figma and use it for your everyday projects it&rsquo;s completely free for a starter team. This will give you 3 projects with unlimited files. Wanting to ramp up the projects and use the team component library? You&rsquo;re looking at around \$12 per editor/month. Honestly, this is a fair price for the amount of value you can get out of Figma and if you just want to try it give the Starter / Individual plan a try.</p>
