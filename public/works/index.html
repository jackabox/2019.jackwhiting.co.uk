          <h2>MSS</h2>
          I was commisioned by an agency to help update the web presence of MSS. This involved completely redesigning their site and I worked on implementing the design into WordPress whilst adding a little bit of flair to the site.

          <h2>PBFA</h2>
          PBFA (Provincial Booksellers Fairs Association) used to run their organisation from a server located in the corner of their room. I worked with them to move their process online and automate several long tedious steps to reduce the admin required for planning out their fairs.

          <h2>Ensek</h2>
          Ensek wanted a new online presence to show off the company ethos and help them target new prospects. This site was built using Craft CMS to provide the best experience for updating and managing their content.

      <div class="py-10">
          <h2>Rollerdor</h2>
          Rollerdor wanted to move away from selling their products on eBay into their own environment. This site had two parts, a Larvel application which targeted the automating of creating specifications for custom doors and a WooCommerce store for selling their addon products.

          <h2>HoleHearted</h2>
          While launching their clothing brand, HoleHearted needed an online store that could show off their personality and help them process all their orders with ease. The site was built and designed by myself on WordPress/WooCommerce to provide the client with ease in the management of their site.
