      <title>Getting Started With Svelte: Installation &amp; Integrating Tailwind CSS</title>

      <description>This article is part of a series of posts with working on Svelte. This is part one in the series and will soon follow the integration of Routing and Firebase.
Svelte is an awesome underdog in JavaScript frameworks and is climbing the ranks currently due to the way it compiles your scripts and HTML. Svelte is inherently a compiler and all of your components files get compiled into pure JavaScript.</description>

      <title>A Few Thoughts on Being a Freelancer</title>

      <description>Over the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved into Freelancing full-time and it&amp;rsquo;s been both a breath of fresh air and also an overwhelming experience.
I have always done freelance on the side for many years, and even worked freelancing while I was at university. The experience of working on many side projects and managing projects were great as I stepped into freelancing full-time, but there was nothing that really prepared me for the mental hurdles other than jumping in.</description>

      <title>Using Firebase Admin SDK with Netlify Lambda Functions</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been recently leaning into spinning up applications with Nuxt and Firebase. These are pretty straight forward applications that handle user authentication and creating/reading of data. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently come into a case where I needed to send out a request to a third party service and write that back to the database. You could do this within Firebase Functions, but it would require you to be signed up onto one of the paid plans - which I&amp;rsquo;m not quite ready for yet.</description>

      <title>Handling Redirects in Nuxt.js through Middleware</title>

      <description>I recently published an article about how to handle redirects in Laravel, since I also use Nuxt.js I thought it would be good to write up how to handle redirects simplistically through pure Nuxt (no server, no advanced configuration).
To do this we&amp;rsquo;ll need to leverage the serverMiddleware, you can learn more about this from the official Nuxt.js docs, but in short, it allows for us to handle additional routes that aren&amp;rsquo;t defined within the folder structure (for example an API).</description>

      <description>In this article, we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about an easy way to manage our redirects within a Laravel application. The following will allow for the storing of redirects in a database (to hook into Nova, or another CRUD system) and also the reading of redirects from a config file.
A lot of the hard work has been done for us by the wonderful team at Spatie whom have produced a redirector package which allows for route params to be read and parsed.</description>

      <title>Awesome Laravel Nova Packages to Get You Started</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Laravel Nova a lot since it&amp;rsquo;s release and find myself using the same packages across projects just because they&amp;rsquo;re awesome and work well. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled a list of my five favourite packages to include in your Laravel Nova install.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t used Nova before, it&amp;rsquo;s an admin package written for Laravel and allows for rapid prototyping of a CRUD admin system quickly. It&amp;rsquo;s also extensible and all written within Vue/Tailwind.</description>

      <description>In the last 6 months, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to using Figma on a permanent basis. I&amp;rsquo;d spent a fair bit of time in and out of the beta, and now with the official launch, it feels more stable and ready for full time use than ever.
With I first tried Figma up it was a bit rough around the edges, it needed refinement and missed some of the fundamentals I was used to, such as Symbols (Sketch had tainted me).</description>

      <guid>https://jackwhiting.co.uk/posts/working-with-local-packages-in-laravel/</guid>
      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on developing a set of packages for Laravel to wrap up some of the code we write on a daily basis. Whilst developing I needed a way to reference a local package to my Laravel install and wanted to use composer.json to include, and update it&amp;rsquo;s dependancies.
To do this, I found it often easier to symbolic link my package into a directory within my Laravel project called packages/namespace/package-name and then set up Composer to read it automatically.</description>

      <title>Using Accessors and Mutators to Abstract Common Functionality within Laravel</title>
      <link>https://jackwhiting.co.uk/posts/using-accessors-and-mutators-within-laravel/</link>

      <guid>https://jackwhiting.co.uk/posts/using-accessors-and-mutators-within-laravel/</guid>
      <description>A common thing I&amp;rsquo;ve found when analysing or revisiting code, is that logic will be repeatedly written throughout different parts of an application, be it in different controllers or views, or even extra database tables are created to store logic that is calculated, potentially increasing query counts.
Laravel has a pretty awesome way of allowing us to utilise the model to contain this logic and reduce repetition.
This is done via the use of Accessors and Mutators.</description>

      <description>On the 7th February, I attended not only my first online conference but my first Laravel dedicated conference and simply put - it was amazing.
Laracon Online 2018 featured talks that covered both technical and theoretical topics and were delivered by speakers who possessed complete passion and charisma.
One of my main highlights was Jonathan Reinink who delivered a talk about &amp;ldquo;Advanced Querying with Eloquent&amp;rdquo; which even now, 6 days later, had me astounded.</description>

      <description>Preface Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with the use of WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for development. I&amp;rsquo;ve used a Mac for development work over better part of the last decade and required the Windows setup to mimic my workflow.
Typically, I create Laravel applications along with the occasional WordPress site, using the following tools:
 Nginx PHP MySql Dnsmasq Valet  After a bit of testing and reconfiguration, I managed to get WSL setup with the above in a few easy steps and I&amp;rsquo;m relatively happy with the workflow.</description>

      <description>This post was written for internal development when working at Adtrak to help with stepping into WordPress Plugin development. The following article is a copy of this with some slight modifications.
Plugins play a key part in how we handle WordPress builds and offer services to clients. Whether it is a plugin such as our “Core” which adds repeatedly used code to WordPress and cleans up the outputs of themes, or something a little more complex such as the “Skip Hire Plugin” which provides a full e-commerce solution for booking skips online.</description>

 You can find out more about this change at https://ma.ttias.be/chrome-force-dev-domains-https-via-preloaded-hsts/
As long as I can remember, I&amp;rsquo;ve used .dev as a preference for local domains. It seemed like the industry standard and was recommend by a lot of developers. When I woke up to find all my .</description>

      <description>Over the past few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally got around to working with Laravel again in my agency. The last time I used the framework on commercial projects was back at version 4, this was when I was working with a team on Pancake App.
The majority of my time these days is spent building Wordpress sites and plugins such as; Raw Halo. (A commerce store built on WooCommerce) and the Skip Hire Plugin to allow skip companies to purchase skips from their websites.</description>

Intro Within the last year or so, I stumbled across Herbet. Herbert is a plugin framework for WordPress that allows for a structured approach, similar to that of Laravel but tailored for a WordPress context.</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of Yarn before, it is a Package Manager for JavaScript (which replaces the existing workflow used with the NPM client). Yarn shares a similar workflow, but puts security, speed and reliability at the forefront.
Why Yarn Over NPM? So, what makes Yarn better than just carrying on using NPM?
Speed, Yarn caches packages so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to downloaded it again and again. It also runs the process parallel so the runtime is a lot shorter.</description>

I require my editor to be customisable, is extendable and has support for colour schemes (it’s the little things). When I stumbled on Visual Studio (VS) Code recently and found that it and ticked all of my boxes, I decided to dive in and test it out.</description>

I had previously written a blog post titled “University Isn’t Everything”, this continues the thoughts expressed in that post.
When I wrote the first post on this subject, I wanted to express my thoughts on why university didn&amp;rsquo;t feel all that fulfilling or stimulating with regards to moving into the Web Design Industry. It requires a lot more then a degree to become successful and I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is portrayed well within university.</description>
