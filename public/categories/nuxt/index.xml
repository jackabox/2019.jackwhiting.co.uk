      <description>I recently published an article about how to handle redirects in Laravel, since I also use Nuxt.js I thought it would be good to write up how to handle redirects simplistically through pure Nuxt (no server, no advanced configuration).
To do this we&amp;rsquo;ll need to leverage the serverMiddleware, you can learn more about this from the official Nuxt.js docs, but in short, it allows for us to handle additional routes that aren&amp;rsquo;t defined within the folder structure (for example an API).</description>
