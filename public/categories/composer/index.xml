      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on developing a set of packages for Laravel to wrap up some of the code we write on a daily basis. Whilst developing I needed a way to reference a local package to my Laravel install and wanted to use composer.json to include, and update it&amp;rsquo;s dependancies.
To do this, I found it often easier to symbolic link my package into a directory within my Laravel project called packages/namespace/package-name and then set up Composer to read it automatically.</description>
