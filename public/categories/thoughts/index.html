      <p>Over the last few months, I&rsquo;ve moved into Freelancing full-time and it&rsquo;s been both a breath of fresh air and also an overwhelming experience.
I have always done freelance on the side for many years, and even worked freelancing while I was at university. The experience of working on many side projects and managing projects were great as I stepped into freelancing full-time, but there was nothing that really prepared me for the mental hurdles other than jumping in.</p>

    <div class="column w-9/12">
      <p>Over the past few weeks, I&rsquo;ve finally got around to working with Laravel again in my agency. The last time I used the framework on commercial projects was back at version 4, this was when I was working with a team on Pancake App.
The majority of my time these days is spent building Wordpress sites and plugins such as; Raw Halo. (A commerce store built on WooCommerce) and the Skip Hire Plugin to allow skip companies to purchase skips from their websites.</p>

      <p>This post was originally published in 2014, it was updated in 2016.
I had previously written a blog post titled “University Isn’t Everything”, this continues the thoughts expressed in that post.
When I wrote the first post on this subject, I wanted to express my thoughts on why university didn&rsquo;t feel all that fulfilling or stimulating with regards to moving into the Web Design Industry. It requires a lot more then a degree to become successful and I don&rsquo;t think this is portrayed well within university.</p>
