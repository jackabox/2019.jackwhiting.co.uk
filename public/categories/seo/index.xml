      <description>I recently published an article about how to handle redirects in Laravel, since I also use Nuxt.js I thought it would be good to write up how to handle redirects simplistically through pure Nuxt (no server, no advanced configuration).
To do this we&amp;rsquo;ll need to leverage the serverMiddleware, you can learn more about this from the official Nuxt.js docs, but in short, it allows for us to handle additional routes that aren&amp;rsquo;t defined within the folder structure (for example an API).</description>

      <description>In this article, we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about an easy way to manage our redirects within a Laravel application. The following will allow for the storing of redirects in a database (to hook into Nova, or another CRUD system) and also the reading of redirects from a config file.
A lot of the hard work has been done for us by the wonderful team at Spatie whom have produced a redirector package which allows for route params to be read and parsed.</description>
