## Freelance Web Developer

**Hey, I am Jack a freelance Web Developer located in Nottingham, UK with over 10 years experience.**

I specialise in crafting websites with PHP and JavaScript. A few of my favourite tools are Laravel, Craft, Shopify, WordPress and VueJS. I make sure to use the best system for each individual project!

Before I decided to go freelance, I've worked across multiple digital agencies as (Lead) Web Developer which has granted me experience across all stages of delivering a website and allows me to push this knowledge into any work I undertake.
