**I'm a freelance web consultant located in Nottingham, UK with over 10 years of experience.**

I specialise in crafting websites with PHP and JavaScript. A few of my favourite tools are Laravel, Craft, Shopify, WordPress, VueJS & Svelte. I use a broad range of tools to ensure that the best system is used for each project!

Before I become a freelancer, I worked across multiple digital agencies as a Web Developer which granted me experience across all stages of delivering a website and allows me to push this knowledge into any work I undertake.

I have also recently started writing more blog posts and starting courses on how to use certain technologies and I am excited to see where this goes. You can check these out in [my posts](/posts/).
