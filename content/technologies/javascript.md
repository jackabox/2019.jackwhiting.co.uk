JavaScript frameworks are all the rage at the moment. Two of my personal favourites are Vue.js and Svelte. They both provide an easy to read and maintain syntax along with a community of support and open-source packages.

If you need an SPA (Single page application) or a PWA (Progressive Web App) these can all be carefully crafted with Vue or Svelte and built as an addition to your API or a standalone site.

Vue/Svelte can also be used if you just want to spice up your website and add elements of complex interactivity to pages (such as guided forms, product builders, etc).
