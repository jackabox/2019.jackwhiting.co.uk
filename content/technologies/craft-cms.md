Craft is one of my favourite CMS around. It is packed with a tonne of unique features and everything included is just one step ahead of the competitors. I love working with it and there are several reasons you should love using it.

If you have never used Craft before, then you will love the control panel and flexibility that is provided along with the superb internationalisation, flexible content and constant patches for security.

If you need to sell products online - Craft Commerce allows for the setup of a store so you can manage products, taxes, and shipping as needed whilst still utilising all the power and speed of the Craft platform.
