WordPress powers roughly 30% of the sites on the internet and as such makes it an extremely popular platform to use.

As a rule of thumb, all WordPress sites developed are written from the ground up with no use of templates and no off the shelf solutions (which can cause a multitude of problems). I tend to keep plugins to a minimum, only utilising trusted sources.
